# Notes for Class 4 (6/4/20)
### Process & Design

+ **It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they would find, and when they are likely to return.**
  - Try creating "customer profiles" to answer difficult design questions.
  - Profiles should answer questions about the target audience members, who are they, what do they do, what is their income, what responsibilities do they have?
+ **Site maps allow you to plan the structure of your site.**  
+ **Wireframes allow you to organize the info that will go on each page.**
  - Using wireframes/site map templates from sites like gomockingbird.com/lovelycharts.com/cacoo.com
+ **Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.**
  - Remember Proximity, Closure(similar shape grouping), Continuance, White Space, Color, Borders.
  - You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
  - You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the info you present.

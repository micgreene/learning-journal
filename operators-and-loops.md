# Notes for Class 8 (6/9/20)

## Operators and Loops

### Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions
- Is equal to `==`: Compares 2 values to see if they are the same.
- Strict equal to `===`: Compares 2 values to check for both data type and value.
- is not equal to `!=`: Compares two values to se3 if they are NOT the same.
- Strict is not equal to `!==`: Compares 2 values to check that _both_ the data type and value are NOT the same.
- Greater than `>`: checks if number of left is greater than number on right.
- Less than `<`: checks if number on left is less than number on right.
- Greater than or equal to `>=`: checks if number on left is greater than or equal to number on right.
- Less than or equal to `<=`: checks if number on left is less than or equal to number on right.

### Structure
(some variable)(asignment operator)(comparison): `X = (score >= pass)`

### Logic Operators
- Logical and `&&`: this tests more than one condition. `((2 < 5) && (3 >= 2))` equals true because BOTH comparisons are true
- Logical or `||`: this operator tests at LEAST one condition `((2 < 5) || (2 < 1))` still equals true because at least one comparison is true

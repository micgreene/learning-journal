# Class 7 Notes (6/8/20)

## Programming with Javascript

### How Javascript makes web pages more interactive

1. **Access Content**
  - You can use JS to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page.
  
1. **Modify Content**
  - You can use JS to add/remove any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page
  
1. **Program Rules**
  - You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow which allows it to access or change the contents of a page.
  
1. **React to Events**
  - You can specify a certain script to run in response to certain events.
  
  
  ### Solving Coding Problems
  Approach each situation uniquely:
  1. **Define the Goal**
    - What do I need this script/page to do?
  1. **Design the Script**
    - Design conceptualy how the code will operate and what pieces need to be created.
    - Use flowcharts tp path out logic visually.
  1. **Code Each Step**
    - Go through multiple iterations until optimal efficiency is discovered.
    
    
    ### Expressions
    An _expression_ evaluates into (results in) a single value. 
    There are two types:
    
    1. Single Assignment Expressions
      - Example: `var string = 'strang';`
    2. Expressions That Use Two or More Values
      - Example: `var area = 3 * 2;
      
    ### Operators
    - Assignment Operators
      + `this = 'that';`
    - Arithmetic Operators
      + `3 * 2;`  `3 / 2;`  `3 + 2;`  `3 - 2;`
      + `++` - increment  `--` = decrement
      
    - String Operators
      + `greeting = 'hi ' + 'guy';`
    - Comparison Operators
    _compares two values to see if true or false then returns boolean_
      + buy = 3 > 5;
    - Logical Operators
    _Combines mutiple comparison opertors and returns boolean_
      + buy = (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);

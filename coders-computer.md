# Notes for Class 2 (6/2/20)
### Selecting a Text Editor
The author lays out several suggestions for preferences in a text editor:

1. Code completion
  + Many text editors give you several options for completed code depending on what you start writing in order to expedite writing long scripts

1. Syntax highlighting
  + Certain text editors will highlight different elements of your code various colors in order to make logic and errors standout more.

1. A nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue)

1. The ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them.
  + Extensions are plug-ins that extend the functionality of your editor.

### Important Caveats
+ **Always use plain text when writing code in your editor, there should be no text formatting**

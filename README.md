Growth mindset centers around believing one is capable of changing themselves in the way that they envision. A growth minded person always looks to defeat the version of themselves from yesterday in some way.

### Important points to maintain a growth mindset mentality:
1. **Do not** fear failure. To be defeated is only an opportunity to understand your current weaknesses.
1. Share what you make, and encourage others also brave enough to share. The fear of embarassment is synonymous with the fear of failure.
1. Get _excited_ for new challenges! The hardest thing you've accomplished has now made everything easier _forever_.



## Markdown Notes (Class 1 - 6/1/20)
>Markdown is a light weight markup language. Allows creation of code using intuitive, quick commands rather than convoluted language.

**DO NOT FORGET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE OPERATOR AND YOUR TEXT**

- # Level 1 Heading: `# Text`
- ## Level 2 Heading: `## Text`
- ### Level 3 Heading: `### Text
- For bulleted lists: `- Text or + Text`
1. For numbered lists: `1. Texta... 1. Textb... 1. Textc`
- **For BOLD Words**: `**Text**`
- _For ITALIC words_: `_Text_`
- `For Code blocks that don't markup` (Use the backtick key above 'Tab'): `'`Text`'`

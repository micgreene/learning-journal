## Growth Mindset
> "Now that I've experienced 100x Earth's gravity... I have to TRAIN in 100x Earth's gravity!" - Son Goku

Growth mindset centers around believing one is capable of changing themselves in the way that they envision. A growth minded person always looks to defeat the version of themselves from yesterday in some way.

Important points to maintain a growth mindset mentality:
1. **Do not** fear failure. To be defeated is only an opportunity to understand your current weaknesses.
1. Share what you make, and encourage others also brave enough to share. The fear of embarassment is synonymous with the fear of failure.
1. Get _excited_ for new challenges! The hardest thing you've accomplished has now made everything easier _forever_.

## Markdown Notes
>Markdown is a light weight markup language. Allows creation of code using intuitive, quick commands rather than convoluted language.
